    Dynamic Instrumental Variable Structural equation model.

    Adapted from from task 3 (experimental section): Structural Causal Bandits: Where to Intervene?

    Note that the dictionary returned respects the causal ordering of each time-slice in the graph.

    Notes
    -----
    1. ^ is the XOR operator used to model binary interactions
    2. The discrete white noise definition is quite similar to the continuous noise definition, meaning that it has mean zero (constant), and its variance is also constant (nonzero), and there's no autocorrelation
    3. U_XY is the confounding variable between X and Y
    4. We can bolt-on transition functions too to make the problem even harder
